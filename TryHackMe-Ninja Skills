Most of the chellenges can be completed by changing the following one liner:

sh> cmmd=' ';for name in $(cat names);do echo $name $($cmmd `find / -name $name 2>/dev/null`);done

It will execute what you put in "cmmd" in each file.
If you want you can add a grep at the end so it only displays the correct one, but I liked the long list to I used the first option.

sh> cmmd=' ';condition=' ';for name in $(cat names);do echo $name $($cmmd `find / -name $name 2>/dev/null`) | grep $condition;done

with "names" being all the files except "bny0":
8V2L
c4ZX
D8B3
FHl1
oiMO
PFbD
rmfX
SRSq
uqyw
v2Vb
X1Uy 

bny0 causes problems that I'm too lazy to troubleshoot ;)



#1- cmmd='ls -l '

#2- This ones requires us the use regex to find the IP:
  sh> for name in $(cat names);do echo $name $(cat `find / -name $name 2>/dev/null` | grep -G '[*\.*\.*\.*\.*]');done

#3- cmmd='sha1sum '

#4- cmmd='wc -l '
  All the files will have the same line count, except the correct one (bny0)!
  
#5- By doing "cat /etc/passwd" we can find which use has the UID 502.
  Now just set cmmd='ls -l ' and see which file that user owns!
 
#6- cmmd='ls -l' and check which has -rwxrwxr-x
